        identifier: Text string for system identifier. Must be < 100 characters
            and not contain any EnergyPlus special characters. This will be used to
            identify the object across a model and in the exported IDF.
        vintage: Text for the vintage of the template system. This will be used
            to set efficiencies for various pieces of equipment within the system.
            Choose from the following.

            * DOE Ref Pre-1980
            * DOE Ref 1980-2004

        equipment_type: Text for the specific type of the system and equipment. (Default:
            the first option below) Choose from.

            * DOAS with VRF

        sensible_heat_recovery: A number between 0 and 1 for the effectiveness
            of sensible heat recovery within the system. If None, it will be
            whatever is recommended for the given vintage (Default: None).
        latent_heat_recovery: A number between 0 and 1 for the effectiveness
            of latent heat recovery within the system. If None, it will be
            whatever is recommended for the given vintage (Default: None).
