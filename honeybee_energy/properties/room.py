        This parameter is used to derive air flow for the four cracks around the

        and one on each side. Since this value is derived from the infiltration flow
        rate per exterior area, which represents an average over many types of air
        leakage rates, this value is not intended to be representative of actual opening
        edges flow coefficients. The normalized perimeter air mass flow coefficient is
